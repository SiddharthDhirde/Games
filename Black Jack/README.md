Welcome to the Blackjack game! This game provides a simple implementation of the classic card game Blackjack, where the goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over.

   - Choose to either "Hit" (receive another card) or "Stand" (keep your current hand).
   - Continue hitting until you are satisfied with your hand or until you exceed 21 (bust).
